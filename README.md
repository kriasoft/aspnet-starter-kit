ASP.NET Web Application Starter Kit
-----------------------------------

> This project template is an ASP.NET solution skeleton for a typical web
> application or single-page application (SPA). You can use it to quickly
> bootstrap your web application projects. It contains only server-side
> components and is recommended to be paired with a front-end project similar
> to [angular-seed][1], [react-seed][2], or one generated by [Yeoman][3].

### Technology Stack

 * [SQL Server Database Tools (SSDT)][4] — provides an integrated environment
   for database developers to carry out all their database design work for any
   SLQ Server platfrom (both on and off premise) within Visual Studio.
 * [Owin][5] and [Katana][6] — a standard interface between .NET web servers
   and web applications along with a flexible set of components for building
   and hosting modular web applications.
 * [Entity Framework (EF)][7] — an object-relational mapper that enables .NET
   developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It
   eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually
   need to write.
 * [ASP.NET Identity][8] — a new membership system for building ASP.NET web
   applications. It supports OAuth / token-based authentication, two-factor
   authentication, claims-based authentication, Facebook / Google / Twitter etc.
 * [ASP.NET Web API][9] — allows to build HTTP services that reach a broad
   range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. It's an ideal
   platform for building RESTful applications on the .NET Framework.
 * [SignalR][10] — a new library for ASP.NET developers that makes developing
   real-time web functionality easy. SignalR allows bi-directional communication
   between server and client and supports a wide range of clients.
